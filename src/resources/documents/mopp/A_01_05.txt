Modification History 
1.5.1 Objective 
The Assurance and Risk  Management Services Charter has been developed to provide a broad framework, professional standards and guidelines for the conduct of assurance, audit and risk management activities.
The Charter is subject to an annual review to ensure it is relevant, aligned with organisational changes and good practices, and an appropriate level of cost-effective value-added services is achieved.
The Assurance and Risk Management Services Charter is approved by Audit and Risk Management Committee on delegated authority from QUT Council.
Top 
1.5.2 Role of Assurance and Risk Management Services 
The primary purpose of Assurance  and Risk Management Services  is to add value to the University's operations and assist the University to  achieve its corporate goals by providing independent analysis, appraisals,  recommendations, counsel and information on the University's systems of  internal control, effectiveness of risk management and the quality of  performance. This is achieved by examining and evaluating the adequacy,  effectiveness and efficiency of risk management, systems of internal control, and the quality of management  in an independent and professional manner.
Assurance  and Risk Management Services should not be involved in setting the risk  appetite or taking decisions on risk responses and implementing these responses  on behalf of management. The identification, assessment and treatment of risks  remain management responsibility and accountability. In addition, Assurance and Risk Management  Services should not develop or implement procedures or systems, prepare  records, or be engaged in original line processing functions. This does not  exclude Assurance and Risk Management professionals from suggesting system development  projects or being consulted on proposed and/or existing systems.
A review or appraisal by  Assurance and Risk Management Services does not in any way relieve officers of  the University of their individual responsibilities and accountabilities.
Top 
1.5.3 Authority 
The Director, Assurance and  Risk Management Services, is authorised to direct a broad, comprehensive  program of assurance, audit and risk management within the University. The Director, Assurance and Risk  Management Services, and staff are authorised to have full, free and  unrestricted access to all functions, property, personnel, records, accounts, files and other documentation. Information accessed in the course of audits is  to be used strictly for audit purposes.
The  Director, Assurance and Risk Management Services, will have unfettered access to the Vice-Chancellor and to Audit and Risk Management Committee and is  responsible for the management of Assurance and Risk Management Services.
Top 
1.5.4 Independence 
Independence is essential to the effectiveness  of the delivery of assurance, audit and risk management services.  This independence is obtained primarily  through organisational status and objectivity.
The Director, Assurance and  Risk Management Services is responsible to Audit and Risk Management Committee  to ensure not only the broadest range of assurance, audit and risk management  coverage but also adequate consideration of audit reports and appropriate  action on audit recommendations.
Assurance and Risk Management  Services operates within the Chancellery directly reporting, for administrative  purposes, to the Vice-Chancellor. The Director, Assurance and Risk Management  Services is responsible to the Vice-Chancellor for the performance of the assurance,  audit and risk management function  and the performance of staff in Assurance and Risk Management Services in  accordance with the University's relevant management performance schemes. The  Vice-Chancellor is responsible for ensuring resourcing support in respect of  the assurance and risk management function within the context and constraints of the  University's planning and resourcing framework and principles. Resources may be  provided in respect of Assurance and Risk Management Services staff who are employees of  the University or for contracting for related services by persons other than  officers of the University.
Assurance  and Risk Management Services  staff must be independent of the activities they audit and will report to the  Director, Assurance and Risk Management Services any situations in which a  conflict of interest or bias is present or may be reasonably inferred. Assurance  and Risk Management Services  staff must not assume operating responsibilities.
