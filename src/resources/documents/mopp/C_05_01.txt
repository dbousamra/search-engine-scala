Modification History
5.1.1 Policy principles 
Assessment practices at QUT are designed to  contribute to high quality learning by students and underpin the development,  delivery and quality assurance of courses, and are based on the following  principles:
  Assessment is valued as a strategy to support  student learning
  Assessment cohesively links the learning  outcomes, content, and learning and teaching approaches at the unit and course  levels
  Assessment is an integral part of the whole of  course design and gives particular attention to the needs of first year  students
  Assessment provides valid evidence of learning  outcomes at the unit level and may contribute to assessment of student learning  at the course level including graduate capabilities
  Assessment approaches are consistent with QUT's  approach to real world learning and teaching and include a variety of  assessment items
  Assessment reflects rigorous academic standards  associated with the discipline and is based on pre-determined and clearly  articulated criteria, associated standards and weightings
  Assessment is fair, equitable and inclusive and  clearly communicated to students
  Assessment patterns provide progressive, timely  and meaningful feedback to students and staff through both formative and  summative elements
  Assessment approaches ensure that reliable and  consistent judgments are made about a student's performance and that academic  integrity is promoted
  Assessment is reviewed as part of course quality  assurance processes to facilitate effective learning and maximise efficiency  for students and staff.
Top 
5.1.2 Policy outcomes 
The policy for assessment is designed to
  clearly and succinctly articulate QUT&rsquo;s  assessment principles and practices to students, staff and external  stakeholders
  provide a robust framework to develop, implement  and evaluate assessment practices, procedures, protocols, resources and tasks
  state minimum quality standards for assessment  practices
  encourage innovation and experimentation in  assessment of student learning
  address issues of equity and fairness.
Top 
5.1.3 Designing assessment  for learning 
Assessment is an integral part of the curriculum design for  any course or unit (C/4.2). Both unit and course coordinators have a  responsibility to ensure that the choice of learning activities and associated  assessment items are clearly informed by the desired learning outcomes and are  consistent with whole of course design.
At the course level, course coordinators are responsible for  ensuring that assessment design and practice is
  consistent with the course design in that it  assists students to achieve the desired learning outcomes of the course
  comprehensive in that it addresses the learning  outcomes of the course, challenges students to deeper learning, and provides  opportunities for students to demonstrate their full capabilities
  sequenced to allow students to progressively and  realistically build their capabilities.
At the unit level, unit coordinators are responsible for  ensuring that assessment design and practice
  is relevant to life and professional contexts  consistent with QUT's real-world approach to learning and teaching (C/4.2)
  is efficient in terms of both student and staff  workload in relation to the value of the task
  is effective to provide clear, relevant, valid  and reliable evidence of the learning outcomes desired from the unit
  provides a reasonable spread of assessment items  throughout the teaching period so that timely feedback can be provided to  assist students to achieve the unit learning outcomes
  is inclusive to promote equal opportunities for  students from diverse backgrounds to excel.Top 
5.1.4 Assessment patterns 
QUT has established  typical assessment patterns (number, types and weights of assessment items) to  support good practice principles (C/5.1.1) and ensure that assessment within a unit  meets the design specifications outlined in C/5.1.2. These assessment patterns apply to all  courses and units unless an exception has been approved as part of the  curriculum development and approval process (C/4.1). Exceptions to  the typical assessment patterns must be accompanied by a clear academic  rationale. Exceptions may be approved to satisfy prescribed professional accreditation  requirements or support substantive discipline requirements. Exceptions must be  consistent with the principles of the assessment policy (C/5.1.1) and curriculum design policy (C/4.2), and must be  clearly communicated to students (C/5.1.6).
A 12 credit point unit includes either two or three summative assessment  items. Weightings for each item of assessment must be a whole percent in  increments of 5% (eg 45%) and the weighting must not be expressed as a range (eg  between 30% and 40%). 
Weightings for assessment items meet the following patterns
  the maximum weighting of an assessment item is 60%  of the total summative assessment for the unit
  the minimum weighting of an assessment item is 10%  of the total summative assessment for the unit
  the maximum weighting for examinations is 60% of  the total summative assessment for the unit
  the maximum weighting for the collective component  of team work is 50% of the grade for the unit.
Note: Theses (C/3.1.3 (d)) are outside  the scope of this policy.

5.1.5 Criteria and  standards 
QUT has adopted a  criterion-referenced approach to assessment where assessment is based on  pre-determined and clearly articulated criteria and associated standards of  knowledge, skills, competencies and/or capabilities. 
Course coordinators  are responsible for ensuring a whole of course approach to assessment (C/5.1.3) including alignment of criteria and  standards to unit and course learning outcomes.
Unit coordinators  are responsible for
  establishing  valid criteria that are consistent with the assessment item and aligned to the  relevant unit learning outcomes
  establishing  clear standards that are high but attainable and designed to motivate students  and impact positively on their learning
  communicating  criteria and performance standards to students in a timely manner, well before  they commence the assessment item.
Top 
5.1.6 Communication and feedback  to students
(a)	Notification  of assessment requirements
The unit outline provides students with broad details of  assessment items (the number, type, weight, indicative due date, and the unit learning outcomes  to be achieved). Changes made to assessment requirements once the  teaching period has commenced require agreement of all students taking the  unit, endorsement from the course coordinator and head of school, and approval  of the change to the unit outline through the usual faculty approval process  (C/4.5 and C/4.1).
In the first week of the teaching period, unit coordinators provide  students with additional assessment details which include specific due  dates for all assessment items, guidance on the type and nature of the  assessment items, further explication of the learning outcomes to be achieved  in each assessment item, and the criteria that will be used to judge the  assessment (C/4.5). 
(b)	Feedback  to students
Unit coordinators are required to provide feedback to  students during the teaching period as an integral component of the learning  process. Unit assessment items should be designed to facilitate the provision  of feedback to students from an early stage in the unit to allow students to  monitor their progress and determine where improvements can be made to enhance  their learning. Strategies to provide formative and summative feedback to  students must be clearly indicated.
(c)	Faculty  policies
Faculties may choose to develop faculty-level policy on  assessment to further define expectations relevant to professional  accreditation or disciplinary practices or clarify normal operational  parameters. Faculty polices are consistent with the principles for assessment  (C/5.1.1) and are subordinate to University policy  which states&nbsp;minimum  quality standards for assessment practices (C/5.1.2). Faculty policies must be clearly  communicated to students.
Top 
5.1.7 Review and moderation  of assessment 
(a)	Review  of courses and units
Unit coordinators are required to ensure the continuous improvement of  the quality of the teaching and learning in their units (C/4.7), and course  coordinators are responsible at the whole of course level for reviewing  assessment and implementing improvements. Unit and course coordinators are  expected to consider the following strategies for review
  consideration of student results to provide  feedback on whether the learning activities in the unit have allowed students  to achieve the required learning outcomes, and to identify common  misunderstandings or gaps in student learning
  moderation of criteria and standards;
  consideration of the assessment practices to ensure  fit with whole of course design
  student feedback from the Learning Experience  Survey or other feedback mechanisms (C/4.7)
  professional accreditation of the course
  independent external consideration of assessment
  benchmarking of criteria, standards and grades with  comparable institutions.
(b)	Moderation
While the  development of well-designed criteria and standards will invest the assessment  process with greater objectivity, of necessity the process must also rely on  the professional judgement of the assessors. For this reason, internal and  external moderation are critical to assure validity and reliability of  assessment practices including the awarding of grades.
Unit coordinators are required to  internally moderate all units (B/3.5.6) to ensure that  marks awarded between tutorial groups and by different teaching staff are  internally consistent, comply with the QUT Grading Scale (C/5.2) and meet  appropriate academic standards. Course coordinators are responsible for  external moderation of assessment to assure academic standards of the course  are appropriate.

5.1.8 Protocols for  assessment  
The University prescribes protocols for assessment consistent with the principles outlined in  this policy. The purpose of these protocols is to clarify policy requirements  and identify associated responsibilities and accountabilities. Assessment  protocols are approved by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Learning and Teaching) and are  available on the Learning and Teaching Unit website.
